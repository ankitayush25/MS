# A Guide to Perpetual Microsoft Office Versions and Their Editions

For decades, Microsoft Office has been available as a "perpetual" license, meaning you pay a one-time fee to own a specific version of the software indefinitely. This contrasts with the subscription-based Microsoft 365, which requires ongoing payments for access to the latest versions and cloud services. Over the years, these perpetual releases have been offered in various "editions" tailored to different user needs, from students to large enterprises.

Here's a breakdown of the most significant perpetual Office versions and the common editions available for each, highlighting the key differences in included applications.

## Understanding the Common Editions

Before diving into the specific versions, it's helpful to understand the typical hierarchy of the retail editions:

**Home & Student**: The most basic and affordable edition, licensed strictly for non-commercial use. It consistently includes the core applications essential for most personal and academic tasks.

**Home & Business**: This edition builds on "Home & Student" by adding Outlook, making it suitable for small business owners and home users who require a robust email client. It is licensed for commercial use.

**Professional**: The most comprehensive retail edition, "Professional" includes all the applications of "Home & Business" and adds database management and desktop publishing software, targeting power users and businesses with more advanced needs.

**Professional Plus**: This edition is typically available through volume licensing channels and sometimes through specific retail channels like developer subscriptions. It includes all the applications in the "Professional" edition and often adds enterprise-grade tools.

# Subscription Office Versions and Editions

## The Shift to Subscription: Understanding Microsoft 365

In contrast to the traditional one-time purchase of a perpetual Office license, Microsoft has increasingly focused on its subscription service, Microsoft 365 (formerly known as Office 365). This model provides users with the latest versions of Office applications plus a suite of cloud-based services for a recurring monthly or annual fee.

The core benefits of the subscription model include:

- **Always-Up-to-Date**: You automatically receive the latest features, security updates, and bug fixes without needing to purchase a new version.
- **Cloud Integration**: Deep integration with services like OneDrive for cloud storage and real-time collaboration on documents.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Install and use the applications on multiple devices, including PCs, Macs, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Expanded Services**: Access to a broader range of applications and services not available in the perpetual versions.

Microsoft 365 is broadly categorized into Home and Business plans, each with different editions to suit specific needs.

## A Closer Look at the Business Plans

- **Microsoft 365 Apps for Business**: This is the most straightforward plan. It provides the desktop Office applications and OneDrive cloud storage but omits the core communication services like Microsoft Teams (full version), Exchange (business-class email), and SharePoint.

- **Microsoft 365 Business Basic**: This plan is the opposite of "Apps for Business." It focuses entirely on cloud services. You get business email, the full version of Teams for meetings and collaboration, and SharePoint, but you can only use the web and mobile versions of the Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).

- **Microsoft 365 Business Standard**: This is the most popular business plan as it combines the offerings of the two previous plans. You get the downloadable desktop Office applications and all the cloud services like Teams, Exchange, and SharePoint.

- **Microsoft 365 Business Premium**: This plan includes everything in Business Standard and adds a robust layer of advanced security and device management features. This includes advanced threat protection with Microsoft Defender and mobile device management with Microsoft Intune, which allows companies to control how Office apps and data are used on employee devices.

## Microsoft 365 for Enterprise

For organizations with more than 300 users or those requiring even more advanced security, compliance, and analytics tools, Microsoft offers Enterprise plans (e.g., Microsoft 365 E3, E5). These plans provide all the features of the business plans plus additional tools for legal compliance, data governance, and in-depth business intelligence.
