🔹 What is POSA?
POSA stands for Point of Sale Activation.

It refers to the retail method of purchasing Microsoft Office, where the customer buys a physical or digital product key card from a store or online marketplace. The key is inactive until it is scanned at the point of sale (billing counter).

🏷️ Key Characteristics of POSA:
Comes as a key card or digital receipt with a 25-character alphanumeric key.

Activation is triggered at the store (Point of Sale).

Used to redeem Office licenses like Office Home & Student, Office Home & Business, or Microsoft 365.

POSA keys must be redeemed online through Microsoft.

🔧 Redemption, Installation & Activation Process:
✅ Step 1: Redemption
Go to https://setup.office.com

Sign in with your Microsoft Account (or create one).

Enter the 25-character Office product key.

Select the country and language.

Click Next — the Office license is now linked to that Microsoft Account.

📥 Step 2: Installation
After successful redemption, you’ll be redirected to your Microsoft Services & Subscriptions page:
👉 https://account.microsoft.com/services

Click Install Office next to the redeemed product.

Download and run the setup file.

Office will install automatically (may take a few minutes).

🔓 Step 3: Activation
After installation, open Word or Excel.

Sign in with the same Microsoft Account used during redemption.

Office will activate automatically via internet.

⚠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting:
Issue	Solution
“Product key already used”	Ask if they’ve redeemed it before. Guide them to https://account.microsoft.com/services
“Key invalid or not recognized”	Verify if it was scanned during purchase; request proof of purchase
“Activation required” even after install	Ensure customer is signed into Office with the correct Microsoft Account
Trying to use same key on multiple devices	Clarify license type — e.g., Home & Student is for one device only

📌 Tips for Support:
Always ask for proof of purchase (receipt or card image) if there’s a key issue.

Never ask the customer to share the full product key — partial key (first 5 characters) is enough for verification/escalation.

Instruct customers to never discard the card or email with the product key — it’s their proof of license.
