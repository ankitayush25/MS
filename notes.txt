Scenario: if the customer is not able to download Microsoft or any office or other application.

1) has he tried downloading form another browser
2) Storage space.
3) Whether the email is in subscription or not
4) error code.
5) how are you trying to install office.
6) do you previously have other office version. (If yes then we have to remove the old office version and restart the pc).

for this case we can use offline installer.  in accounts.microsoft.com go for subscriptions in that scroll down and install. (Click to run option). (Directly installing).
near this we have a small arrow. that is offline installer.

To activate we can
1) Go to word and login into your account which has the subscription and go to account there it will be shown.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
IF ITS A FAMILY SUBSCRIPTION:
1) we have to share the subscription.
2) In accounts.microsoft.com we have to go for subsctiption or share
