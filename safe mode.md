Here's how to start your Windows PC in Safe Mode, step-by-step.

## From Settings (the easiest method)
This method works if you can start your PC normally.

Open Settings: Press the Windows key + I on your keyboard.

Go to Update & Security: In Windows 10, click on Update & Security. In Windows 11, click on System and then select Recovery.

Find Advanced startup:

Windows 10: In the left pane, select Recovery. Under the "Advanced startup" section, click Restart now.

Windows 11: Under "Recovery options," find "Advanced startup" and click Restart now.

Enter the Windows Recovery Environment: Your PC will restart and show a blue screen with options.

Navigate the menus: Click on Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings.

Restart again: Click the Restart button.

Choose Safe Mode: After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Press the number key that corresponds to Enable Safe Mode (usually 4). If you need internet access, press 5 for Safe Mode with Networking.

## From the Sign-in Screen
Use this method if you can't get past the login screen.

Trigger a restart: On the Windows sign-in screen, press and hold the Shift key while you click the Power icon, and then select Restart.

Enter the Recovery Environment: Continue holding the Shift key until the blue "Choose an option" screen appears.

Follow the same navigation: From here, the steps are the same as the method above: go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.

Select Safe Mode: Once the Startup Settings menu appears, press 4 for Safe Mode or 5 for Safe Mode with Networking.

## From a Black or Blank Screen
If your PC isn't starting correctly, you can force it into the Windows Recovery Environment.

Force a shutdown: Press and hold the power button on your PC for about 10 seconds to turn it off completely.

Turn it back on: Press the power button again to start your PC.

Interrupt the boot process: As soon as Windows starts to load (you might see the manufacturer's logo or a spinning circle), press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to turn it off again.

Repeat: Repeat this process of turning the PC on and off two or three times. This will signal to Windows that there's a problem, and it should automatically load the Windows Recovery Environment (the blue screen with options).

Follow the navigation: Once you see the "Choose an option" screen, follow the same steps as before: Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.

Choose Safe Mode: Press 4 or 5 to enter the desired Safe Mode option.
